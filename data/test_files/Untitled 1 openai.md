 Welcome to another ColdFusion video. There's something big happening in China right now.

 Technology is being used like never before to mold a society.

 This episode we'll see exactly what's going on inside the closed doors of China.

 The Chinese government can benefit an enormous amount by this vast array of information.

 As the proverb goes, knowledge is power.

 Chinese hardware companies such as Huawei and ZTE are full and under suspicion.

 This is because the Chinese government has the ability to request his information from any Chinese company.

 In reality, it's easier said than done, even if you boy quoted using a phone.

 Government monitoring goes way beyond the devices in your hand.

 There are 200 million surveillance cameras in eastern China.

 within 3 seconds of recording. While it hasn't reached these levels yet, it's been used to

 to catch jaywalkers, unlicensed drivers, and pick out wanted fugitives in crowds.

 The government uses facial recognition along with an outdoor screen to show

 China. The Chinese government introduced a social credit system which has been tested on

 6% of the population currently. It is anticipated to be completely in place by 2020.

 Now, if you've seen the Black Mirror episode, "No is dive", you know that it's about a world

 where a universal social credit system allows people to rate others depending on even the

 social interactions. The squad is ham into your service for flight. What home

 loaned to get offered, what car you can rent, etc. In the Black Mirror episode.

 The result was that everyone's interactions ended up being fake and too faced, and the system changed the

 Of course, there are ways to get around these firewalls such as web proxies and VPNs.
